- From the picture above, we can see five variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. They are vehicle_length,vehicle_weight,spoiler_angle,ground_clearance and AWD).
- we have p-value of 5.35e-11. If we assumed confidence level is 95%. THen we can compare our p-value (very samll) to significance level of 5%, 0.05. Since 5.35e-11 is smaller than 0.05. We can conclude that we reject the null hyposthesis. When we reject the null, the slope of the linear modle is not zero.
- Our R-squared value is 0.7149, which means that 71% of mpg prediction can be explained by our five variables. We can add more variables to test and to improve.

From the picture above, we can see the mean for all manufacturing lots is 1498.78, median is 1500 and SD is 7.892627. However, when we break down into a deeper analysis:
